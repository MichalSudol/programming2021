You should create a function called <tt>sqrt</tt> that does this.



I am asking you to create your own sqrt function and not to use the built in functions x ** .5 or math.sqrt(x)

I suggest that you look at the newton method at estimating square roots



$ python squareroot.py

Please enter a positive number: 14.5

The square root of 14.5 is approx. 3.8.
